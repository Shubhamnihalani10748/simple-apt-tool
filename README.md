# simple-apt-tool

A simple interactive **Bash script** to install or remove packages from your system.

## About This Project

This is one of my first Bash scripting projects, created to learn Git, GitHub, and command-line automation. It's simple by design but will be improved over time as I learn more.

## Features

- Friendly terminal-based interaction
- Lets users **choose between installing or removing** a package
- Uses `apt` and `sudo` to execute the commands
- Includes basic error handling

## How It Works

1. Greets the user and asks if they want to **install (I)** or **remove (R)** a package.
2. Prompts the user to enter the **package name**.
3. Executes the corresponding `apt install` or `apt purge` command.
4. Displays the **exit status** of the command.



## Usage

Run the script from a terminal:

```bash
bash script.sh
```

## Notes

- Requires sudo permissions.
- Designed for Debian-based systems (like Ubuntu or Termux with apt).
- Just a beginner script â€” feel free to extend or modify it!

> Note: `script.sh` is a work in progress and will continue to receive updates with new features and improvements.
